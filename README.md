# Reactions
Vizualization of concentration curves for chemical reactions. Solved using a finite difference approximation and plotted to show the concentration curves over the course of the reaction. This package could be extended to visualize 'any' set of first order differential equations - e.g. population dynamics.


## Requirements
This package only requires `plotly` and `numpy` and is written in jupyter notebooks.

## How to Use
Usage is explained in the jupyter notebook. Enter in lists of tuples, and the function will generate a plotly plot in another tab. 

## Future Work
* Replace hard-coded components list
* Make input formatting easier
